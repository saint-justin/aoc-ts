## Advent of Code TypeScript
Why hello there! If you're reading this, it means that you've somehow stumbled upon Justin's **Advent Of Code** repository for his TS attempts. 

Let's cover some quick basics:

### What is Advent of Code?
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), or just **AoC**, is an annual event that participants to complete one two-part coding question every day. It's a great way to practice some [Leetcode style programming questions](https://leetcode.com/) using whatever tools they want. The event has a pretty large following, with [over 100k members in the subreddit alone](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode).

**AoC** is a fantastic way to practice a language you already know and pick up some new tricks or a fun way to learn a new language which you've never worked with before! **AoC** is actually the only reason I ever tried Python and the way I've learned Rust as well as I have.
